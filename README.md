# PineTimeAcc
Android app to receive PineTime acceleration data.

This app is meant to be used with a Smartwatch running InfiniTime (https://github.com/InfiniTimeOrg/InfiniTime), in a version that exposes high frequency acceleration data, e.g. my fork for the P8b smartwatch: https://github.com/Stargate01/InfiniTime/tree/acc-fifo-highres .

## Building

Use Android Studio to build the project.
